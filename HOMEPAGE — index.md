# Hi, I'm Veena 👋  
### UX Engineering • Design Systems • Interaction Design • Accessibility

I design and build experiences that are **consistent**, **accessible**, and **developer‑friendly**.  
My work bridges the gap between **design intent** and **production-quality UI** — through systems, documentation, and scalable process thinking.

Welcome to the GitHub Pages version of my professional portfolio.
